cache access to the API or mock calls (recording?)

can I link ant to jshint?

create a main that links to:
  - schools
  - badges
  - users
  - projects (courses)

add error handling when get_JSON fails silently



Writeable API:
One story could be modify your profile
  - Authorisation
  - Authentication
  - GET profile (users) data
  - PUT data
