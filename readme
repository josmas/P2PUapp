- P2PU app -
------------

An app to tease out the P2PU API (and learn phonegap).

This an Android PhoneGap project (http://phonegap.com/).
You can use Eclipse or the command line through ant.

Getting the source:
 1. fork/clone this repo
 2. run '~/android-sdk/tools/android update project 
 --name P2PUapp --target 1 --path /path_to_your_clone/P2PUapp/'

More information about updating the project can be found at:
http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-cmdline.html

From there on you can either import to eclipse or work with any editor/IDE of
your choice.

From command line, after step 2, you can run:
 - ant debug (to build the project)
 - ant debug install (to install to your default device or emulator)

All the HTML5 related files live in the assets/www folder.

The app grabs data from the main P2PU API at:
https://api.p2pu.org/api/alpha/?format=json

The API is quite reduced at the moment, and this app is a way for us to work out
what else we need to do with it.

The code points to http://api.localhost:8000/api/alpha/?format=jsonp&callback=?
which means that you will need a local copy of Lernanta.

Lernanta can be found at: https://github.com/p2pu/lernanta 
And more information about the API at:

Help will be very welcome!
